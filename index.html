    <h1 class="about_header1"><span class="colored_text">About Me</span></h1>

    <p class="about_p1">Hello! My name is Marcell Ilyés and I like creating beautiful, useful and responsive websites and web apps that users enjoy to use.
      My passion for coding started when I was in high school and since then I’ve been improving my web developer skills.
      <br><br>
      I’ve learnt to build functional and responsive websites and web applications from scratch using
      <span class="colored_text"><b>HTML</b></span> and <span class="colored_text"><b>CSS</b></span>
      and currently I’m exploring and learning the vast universe that is called <span class="colored_text"><b>JavaScript</b></span>.</p>
      <img src="img/htmlcssjs.png" class="about_img1" alt="html css and javascript">
      <p class="about_p3">The 3 main building blocks of most of my websites.</p>

      <h1 class="about_header2"><span class="colored_text">How I go about coding?</span></h1>

      <p class="about_p2">Whenever I'm coding I try to approach every task or problem that needs to be solved from various angles.
        For example a certain object or function can be implemented in a website in a lot of different ways,
        but a certain solution can be better than a different one, regarding editability, reusability or expendability in the future.
        <br><br>
        I know that responsiveness is a crucial part in every website, therefore whenever I code
        I always put a lot of effort into making the website responsive so it looks great on all the different devices.
        Although most of the <span class="colored_text"><b><a href="#projects" class="colored_text">school projects</a></b></span> that I've worked on were mainly developed for mobile screens, I can confidently
        create responsive websites on both desktop and mobile devices as well.</p>

      <h2 class="projects_header2"><span class="colored_text"><a href=http://www.nikola-prolic.eu class="colored_text">Electronic music player web application</a></span></h2>
      <p class="projects_p2">This is the most recent school project that I've worked on. The main idea behind the web app
        was to not only create a music player, but also provide additional information about electronic music genres, tracks and artists
        while at the same time giving the user the opportunity to listen to the music with the help of Spotify API's.
        This web app was mainly developed for mobile devices. Out of all the school projects that I had, it was in this one where I worked the most with JavaScript .
      </p>

      <h2 class="projects_header3"><span class="colored_text"><a href=http://cilis.dk/ class="colored_text">Cili's Bakery</a></span></h2>
      <p class="projects_p3">In this project me and my team created a website for an Aarhus based bakery called Cili's.
        We met the owner and made the website based on some of her ideas regarding the design and the different elements to include.
        Being a start-up company, her main problem was the lack of customers, so she asked us to create a website for her that draws
        more attention to the bakery and it's main product. We developed this webpage both for desktop and mobile devices so it's fully responsive.
      </p>

      <h2 class="projects_header4"><span class="colored_text"><a href=# class="colored_text">Bose Headphone product page</a></span></h2>
      <p class="projects_p4">I created this website for the exam project at the end of my first semester. The task was to create a
        product page, showcasing a certain product from a company. In my case I chose a headphone from Bose. At this point I could only
        code using HTML and CSS, so in this project JavaScript was not used. Although the webpage was developed using the Mobile First Approach,
        it's fully responsive and works on desktop devices as well.
